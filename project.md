<hr>

The learning GOAL of this project is for each student to 1) increase their knowledge of real-time embedded systems, as well as 2) acquire or improve a skill related to the design, construction, and/or analysis of a real-time embedded system.

**__WHO__**: This project can be completed independently or with 1 other person. The project must scale with team size and each person’s role and learning objectives must be clearly defined.

**__WHY__**: You motivate the work by identifying your learning objectives. A learning OBJECTIVE is a specific skill, attitude, or value that one is attempting to achieve through an activity. The learning OUTCOME is the skill, attitude, or value acquired through the activity [1]. Please consider the following types of learning objectives:
Cognitive objectives: “What do you want to know?”
Affective objectives: “What do you want to think or care about?”
Behavioral objectives: “What do you want to be able to do?”

**__WHAT__**: Primary Deliverables:
- Proposal that, most importantly, identifies learning objectives with respect to the coursework of Real-Time Embedded Systems, as well as describes the final “product.”
- Write-Up detailing both the anticipated and unanticipated learning outcomes with respect to the learning objectives. Also provide in detail the product of the project.

> I appreciate risk-taking that serves the purpose of learning. This is an academic environment and what better place is there to try those things that have unknown results! I am far more interested in what you LEARN than what you produce.


### Equipment Request

As part of the project proposal, you will need to determine what hardware you need. I would like you to source that hardware and put in a request to me to purchase (or if you want to keep your project, then you should purchase it). Finding hardware can be difficult, particularly if you want it to be somewhat tested with documentation and support (and still be relatively inexpensive). _Amazon_ will suggest a lot of components that you can purchase, but many of them come from China with datasheets in Chinese, which is fine if you speak Chinese, but if you don't you probably won't have a readable datasheet. And as you know, even datasheets written in your native language require additional knowledge to interpret.

It is not necessary to incorporate the AStar32U4 in your project, but if you think about using a different microprocessor, then it is necessary to provide justification.

I have A LOT of equipment -- sensors, motors, robots, Raspberry Pi's, LED strips, power supplies, etc. and I have sourced A LOT of hardware. Please ask if you want to dig through my hardware or you need help with sourcing. 

### Project Proposal

Write a 1 page proposal that outlines your project and learning objectives. This proposal should contain the following information (in a thoughtful, organized manner):
- Project Title
- Short Description
- Team Members
- Detailed Learning Objective for **EACH** Team Member
- Expected challenges of the project (intellectual, mechanical, systems, etc.)
- Background Knowledge/Experience of **EACH** Team Member, relative to the project requirements and learning objectives. There might be a sentence like one of these in your proposal:

  - “I have extensive experience creating microprocessor projects but I have never interfaced one with a mobile device, therefore I will create an RC car that can be remotely controlled with a smart phone.”

  - “I have experience with using sensors but not designing them, therefore I will create a wearable glove that senses orientation of the hand or pose of the fingers using accelerometers.”

  - “I have OS experience but not RTOS, therefore I will install an RTOS and use real-time scheduling for the Positional Control project and compare the results to the non-RTOS version.”

  - “I have very little experience in writing OS services, thus I will create a Real-Time scheduler (kernel) for the AStar32U4.”

  - “I have some experience with manually tuning a PID controller, but nothing very formal. Therefore, I will be conducting a comparative study on different tuning techniques.”

- If there are multiple team members, specify what each person will be working on. I will not accept “We are doing everything together.” Make each person responsible for some aspect of the project.

- Resources: websites, research papers, etc.

### Weekly Progress Report

Write a status "email" that states what you have completed in the previous week and what your goals are for the current week. Make those goals concrete and specific as possible. The audience is your boss at work and possibly the client. Keep it professional - not too casual, organized and brief. Also be prepared to stand up in front of the class and report on your progress.

### Project Write-Up

Papers should be formal to semi-formal, NOT conversational.

- Write a 2-3 page report (1.5 spacing, 1” margins) detailing the learning outcomes of your project, as well what you learned from your research. The writing should be of good quality, analytical, and concise, and contain the following information:

  - Introduction and motivation (what might this product be used for or why did you choose this).
  - Learning OUTCOMES (what did you learn?). Describe any technical or intellectual difficulties that you had to overcome. If applicable, discuss how your outcomes were different from your objectives.
  - Future Work: What are the next steps to work towards your completed project.
  - _A TIP_: Find the crossover of your project and course content. You should emphasize those areas related to real-time embedded systems as discussed in class.
  - References

### Project Discussion / Demonstration

In place of a final, you will have an informal presentation of your project proposal. It should include an introduction to your proposed final product, an overview of the hardware, relevant work of others that you found, and relevant information or skills that you acquired. It doesn't need to be any longer than 5 minutes, but if you have more to say, then feel free to take longer.
